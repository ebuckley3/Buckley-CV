### About Me
I'm a seasoned academic librarian with over ten years experience. Presently, I'm a faculty librarian at Valencia College in Orlando, Florida, earning tenure in 2022. Additionally, I'm an instructor of new student experience and fundamentals of speech. Past institutions I've worked at as a librarian include the University of Central Florida and Hillsborough Community College. I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida in the Text and Technology program, specializing in digital humanities. My past educational experience includes a master of mass communication at South Dakota State University and a master of library science at Clarion University. In my free time I enjoy reading science journalism, crocheting, hiking, and trips to theme parks across Central Florida
